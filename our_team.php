          <h1>Our Team </h1>
          <p><strong>Kris Schmidt - Lead Investigator</strong></p>
          <p>My name is Kris Schmidt, and I am one of the founders of  RisE Paranormal. I was raised in a Christian family and although church was not  a large part of my upbringing, God and spirituality was still considered  important. I spent most of my childhood bouncing back and forth from Colorado  to Arizona, never spending very long in one place. </p>
          <p>I have always had an interest in the paranormal and the  possibility of a spirit world. Spirits living alongside some of my extended  family in their house was common conversation that fueled my curiosity. When I  was a teenager and young adult I had all but lost my faith in religion and the  existence of God. As I continue to develop my knowledge of this field, I grow  increasingly certain that there is a higher power at work, and so much that we  still don’t understand. </p>
          <p>In 2007 Chris Koerber and I combined our interests to form  our own research team, which is RisE Paranormal. We pride ourselves on a debunk  when possible mentality. My view on paranormal research, or “Ghost Hunting”, is  that it should be directed primarily towards assisting people, living or  passed, and secondarily gaining evidence or further understanding of the spirit  world. </p>
          <p>I attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, where I  received my Bachelors of the Arts degree in Mathematics. I am currently  employed in the field of education, pursuing my goal of becoming a high-level  secondary mathematics teacher. Eventually I would like to return to school to  get a masters degree in education. </p>
<p><strong>Chris Koerber - Tech Manager</strong></p>
          <p>My name is Chris Koerber, and I am one of the founders of  RisE Paranormal. I grew up in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado in a little town  called Evergreen. My family isn’t very religious but at times we would attend a  Catholic church near our home. Since these visits were few and far between my  family didn’t talk about religion or spirituality and therefore when I was  growing up I didn’t think much about it. I wouldn’t consider myself very religious  but maybe more spiritual. Every day, it seems, I must re-evaluate my outlook on  spirituality and religion due to the nature of this field, reading material,  views and thoughts expressed and of the evidence collected. </p>
          <p>            I have always been curious about the paranormal but had the  feeling that I was one of the few. After my best friend told me to watch a show  on SyFy called Ghost Hunters, I realized that there were many others out there  that found it as interesting as I do. I am not the type of person that’s likes  to be scared, but at the same time it is the only way to really “dive” into the  paranormal field and get true answers. I wouldn’t consider myself to be a  skeptic, but I do have a very scientific mind and way of thinking, therefore I  come to the paranormal field with the same mindset. </p>
          <p>            During 2007, Kris Schmidt and I created RisE Paranormal in  the attempts to find answers for ourselves along with help others who are  plagued with the unknown. Our main concern is helping those who need it whether  they are among the living or not. In addition our secondary concern is to  obtain and document credible evidence so we may better understand the  paranormal realm.</p>
          <p>            I currently attend Metro  State College of Denver where I am attempting to gain a Bachelors of Business  degree in Computer Information Systems. I worked for an oil company for the  past 8 years, assisting retail stores and management with varying problems and  solutions. I also own a company that supplies web sites and web hosting as well  as other technology specific products. After I complete college, I would like  to find a job that I truly enjoy or work very hard at both of my businesses. </p>
<p><strong>Erik Madrill - Investigator</strong></p>
          <p> My Name is Erik K. Madrill. I was born in Alamosa Colorado but raised mainly in Pueblo Colorado. I have five years of college under my belt, and still attend classes locally. I grew up very religious and continue to be in my adult life.<br />
            <br />
            I was always intrigued and curious about the paranormal field in general, but I never thought I would be this far into it. It's one of those fields of study that can only grow. Nothing is set in stone in this field, and I think that is why I am drawn to it. New techniques, methods, and theories are made all the time and they will always need someone to put them to the test.<br />
            <br />
            I believe there are spirits in this world, but I am very cautious to say something is paranormal. I am the hardcore skeptic of the group. I don’t believe most of the evidence I've seen on television and the Internet, because frankly, everything I have seen can be fabricated or disproved in some way. I am still very skeptical and am not afraid to give the simplest reason for something that &quot;can't be explained&quot;. </p>
